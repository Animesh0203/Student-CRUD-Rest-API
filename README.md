Student API
Project Overview
This project is a RESTful API developed to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on a list of students. Each student record contains the following attributes:

ID (integer): Unique identifier for each student.
Name (string): Full name of the student.
Age (integer): Age of the student.
Email (string): Contact email of the student.
The API is designed to support multiple users and requests, with in-memory data storage for fast access. Additionally, the API integrates with Ollama to generate AI-based summaries for each student's profile. Note: The Ollama integration may require a high-core CPU system for optimal performance.
